Differences between Train, Valid and Test set
	- Train set is used to train a model
	- Valid set is used to validate the model performance/accuracy while training
	- Test set is used to test the model performance/accuracy in real env

Overfittting: Performs well on Train and Valid sets but not on Test set

Dropout is one of the solution for Overfitting. Dropout is randomly inactivate some neurons.
Dropout will make our model more robust so that it will not rely completely on certain neurons.

In Neural network, hidden layers extract the features/patterns from the input(initial layers extract lesser features then subsequent layers extract complex and more complex features)

* Difference between loss function and cost function:
	- Loss Function:- MSE / MAE (Calculate difference between ground truth and predicted value)
	- Cost Function:- Sum of Loss Function

* Activation functions selection:
	- Relu => Regression
	- Sigmoid => Binary Classification
	- Softmax => MultiClass Classification

* Usages of Weight, Bias and Activation function:
	- Weight extracts the low level features (In Number 2 get the Half circle pattern, diagonal line[/], horizontal line[_])
	- Bias shift the neuron activation point (Fans speed determines by which point it sets[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Bias can shift by 0.2[1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2])
	- Activation Function: Activates/Deactivates a neuron and Give non-linear capability
